# Surrogate
Directory matlab contaiins all matlab code.

/matlab/precondition has how to precondition the big data ie, reduce size.
-> it will read data from .h5 files and align them at mmax amplitude.
-> chop each waveform according to the smallest waveform.
--> then do uniform fine sampling near merger and non uniform sampling in phase before.
--> and save all waveform (amp and phase) reduced in size to a .mat

/matlab/Amp will have codes to  generate surrogate for Amplitude
 load .mat data set generated by above code and proceed.

/matlab/phase will have codes to generate surrogate for phase.
load .mat data set generated by above code and proceed.

/matlab/final 
error analysis
code calculates max error maximised over all the waveforms

check.m
codes check waveform for arbitary q, lambda given.
